# Pentest Classification
Pentest classification project as a part of Learning and Adaptivity course completion

Team : Widya Aulia and Desiana Nurchalifah

**Measurement**
* There are 4 types of fountain pens (B, EF, F, M). 
* Each type consists of four pens which measurements are saved in one text file.
* There are 6 sections in the text file, first two sections are left and right movement respectively and the third is the combination of the movements.
* The other sections are the errors for each of the movements minimum followed by maximum.

**Limit**
* Limit file contains which type of pen, variable of range sections, minimum and maximum limit.
* Limit is obtained from Limits of param folder where each pen type is stated its limits.
* For example, in file Federtyp_00, P600=KW_1_MIN_L_01 has data 600=0 where it stated the minimum limit is zero and P650=KW_1_MAX_L_01 has data 650=30 where it stated the maximum limit is 30. Therefore in this particular canal, the test pen has range 0-30.
* The 6/0 values are the accumulation of how many points pass the limit for each measurement time

**Human Evaluation**
* In the excel file, it is stated determination of limit values where in the first sheet, pens are tested with humans.
* In the second sheet pens are tested with machines and compared with the human result ('1' is a good quality pen and '0' is a bad quality pen).
* In the third sheet results are compared with humans. 'X' means bad quality pen and 'O' means good quality pen that is cross-checked.

#### Graph Plot
Plot of graph are attached in plot_graph folder.

After data are obtained, we take possible methods that is able to classify whether the pens are good or bad. We use dimensionality reduction to obtain representative features:
1. KNN classifier and PCA
K-Nearest Neighbor is an algorithm that classifies based on K number of nearest neighbor. The value of K determines whether classification is over-fitting or under-fitting the data. While PCA is feature reduction, where it reduces the number of feature used for each pen type.
2. SVM
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is able to handle non-linear spaces. It separates data points using a hyperplane with largest amount of margin. It is a classification approach where it is able to handle multiple variables.

#### Raw Data Visualization using Spectogram and FFT
Data is then analyzed for left and right hand using spectogram. In this analysis, we are using pandas to process the files

#### Implementing KNN, Random Forest and SVC
On this code, we implement KNN and SVC algorithm and showing the confusion matrix to provide the performance of the classifier. As stated, few bad labeled data affect the accuracy values, hence it has more than 80% accuracy.

#### Application of Data Augmentation
Data is then added by application of Jittering and Permutation in order to add variations to the data.

After application of Augmentation, learning curve shows more generalization to the data, therefore it reduces the probability of the data overfitting

#### Data Classification using Neural Network
Observations and notes:
  * Accuracy is not decreased significantly by reducing features used
  * Neural network consists of two hidden layers and 50 neurons each layer with sigmoid activation
  * Stochastic Gradient Descent is used to optimize the network with binary cross-entropy loss
  * As number of epochs are increased, accuracy also increased
